📊 Bank Loan Data Analysis Project

🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to generate meaningful insights for financial decision-making. It simulates how banks evaluate loan applications, assess credit risk, and monitor loan performance.

The project combines SQL for business problem solving and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

🔹 Objectives

*Understand the process of bank loan approvals and repayments.
*Analyze loan data to identify risk patterns and business opportunities.
*Solve business questions using SQL.
*Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key loan KPIs.

🔹 Tools & Technologies

*SQL – Data exploration & business queries
*Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization
*Excel/CSV – Data source
*Domain Knowledge – Understanding of loan application process, credit checks, DTI, and risk assessment

🔹 Business Questions Answered (SQL)

*What is the overall loan default percentage?
*How are loans distributed across different states?
*Which loan terms (e.g., 36 months vs 60 months) show higher default risk?
*What is the total funded amount and total received amount?
*How do loan grades impact repayment behavior?

🔹 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard highlights:

📌 Loan Approval & Rejection Trends
📌 Funded Amount vs Received Amount
📌 Loan Status Distribution (Fully Paid, Current, Charged-Off)
📌 State-wise Loan Applications
📌 DTI (Debt-to-Income) insights
